# Problem 4A, Watermelon
https://codeforces.com/contest/4/problem/A

This problem is very simple, and can be re-worded in another way:  
Given Integer `X`, do `Y` and `Z` exist such that:
- `Y` + `Z` = `X`
- Both `Y` and `Z` are even
- Both `Y` and `Z` are positive
- Both `Y` and `Z` are non-zero

Thinking about this, no two even numbers can add to an odd number, so right away this rules out all the odd number.  
So this is `X` % 2 == 1, print "NO".

But there is one more edge case to consider. The number 2 only has 1 set of positive, non-zero number that satisfy the first rule, that is 1+1. But since one is 1, 2 is the only even number excluded.  
For the rest of the even numbers, we can use the logic `X-2` + 2 = `X`, and any even number greater than 2 will result in an even, positive and non-zero number when subtracted by 2. So if `X` was 16, 14+2=16, and both 2 and 14 are even, positive and non-zero.  
So this is `X` < 3, print "NO".
